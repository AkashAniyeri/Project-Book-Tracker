The Library Management System tracks book details, availability, and costs. It includes tables for branches, employees, books, customers, and issue/return statuses, ensuring easy management and access to information.



This project helps libraries by building a super-organized system for their books and members. Think of it like a fancy filing cabinet with labeled folders for different things. One section keeps track of each library branch, like their address and phone number. Another section holds all the employee info, like their name, job, pay, and which branch they work at.

The Best part is the book section. Each book gets its own "info card" with details like the title, what kind of book it is (fiction, history, etc.), and who wrote it. There's even a list for all the library members, with their names, addresses, and when they signed up. The employee folders show which branch they belong to, and borrowed books link back to both the person who borrowed it and the book itself. This lets librarians easily find books you can borrow, see which employee works where, or even track down who borrowed a specific book. It's basically a super-organized library filing system which is ready to make things run smoother and give everyone a better library experience.
